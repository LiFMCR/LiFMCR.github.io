# LiFMCR.github.io
LiFMCR is a dataset for registering micro-lens-array-based light field cameras. It provides synchronized sequences from two Raytrix R32 plenoptic cameras with precise 6-DOF poses from a Vicon system. Two baseline methods are included: a 3D RANSAC approach using cross-view point clouds, and a plenoptic PnP algorithm from single light field images.
