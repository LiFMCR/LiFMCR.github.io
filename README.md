# LiFMCR.github.io
We present LiFMCR, a novel dataset for the registration of multiple MLA-based light field cameras. While existing light field datasets are limited to single-camera setups and typically lack external ground truth, LiFMCR provides synchronized image sequences from two high-resolution Raytrix R32 plenoptic cameras, together with high-precision 6-DOF poses recorded by a Vicon motion capture system. This unique combination enables rigorous evaluation of multi-camera light field registration methods.

As a baseline, we provide two complementary registration approaches: a robust 3D RANSAC-based method using cross-view point clouds, and a plenoptic PnP algorithm estimating extrinsic 6-DOF poses from single light field images. Both explicitly integrate the plenoptic camera model, enabling accurate and scalable multi-camera registration. Experiments show strong alignment with ground truth, supporting reliable multi-view light field processing.
